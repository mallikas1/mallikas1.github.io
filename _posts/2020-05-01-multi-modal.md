## Summary
Medical Image Analysis: Project 1: (Prof Jerry Prince, ECE, Johns Hopkins University)

A hybrid segmentation approach employing K-means and KNN for the brain tumor segmentation task to achieve a dice score of 0.59. Extracted hand-crafted intensity, shape, and texture features with random forest regressor for the survival task.
The average segmentation time per subject is 5.71 seconds.
