I'm a research assistant in the Musckuoloskeletal Informatics Group at Boston Children's Hospital - Harvard Medical School. I graduated from Johns Hopkins University with a master's degree in Biomedical Engineering with a focus on machine learning and image analysis. 

Please be patient, I'm slowly building this page.
