  <header><h1>About me</h1></header>
  <p>I'm a research assistant in the Musckuoloskeletal Informatics Group at \n
    Boston Children's Hospital - Harvard Medical School. I graduated from Johns Hopkins University \n
    with a master's degree in Biomedical Engineering with a focus on machine learning and image analysis. \n
    Here is my [CV](/fnu_mallika_resume.pdf) for more details.

  Please be patient, I'm slowly building this page.
