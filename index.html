  <p>I'm a research assistant in the Musckuoloskeletal Informatics Group at
    Boston Children's Hospital - Harvard Medical School. I graduated from Johns Hopkins University 
    with a master's degree in Biomedical Engineering with a focus on machine learning and image analysis.
    Here is my [CV](/fnu_mallika_resume.pdf) for more details.

  Please be patient, I'm slowly building this page.
